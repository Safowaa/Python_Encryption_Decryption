# Python Encryption and Decryption
A basic Python project that can encrypt and decrypt messages.
This tool provides simple yet effective text encryption and decryption capabilities using the Caesar cipher method.

## Features
- **Encrypt messages**: Shifts the letters in your message by a defined number to encrypt it.
- **Decrypt messages**: Reverses the shift to return the original message.

## How It Works
1. **Choose an Option**: You can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message.
2. **Input Your Message**: Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
3. **Get Your Result**: The encrypted or decrypted message will be displayed.

## Example of Use
